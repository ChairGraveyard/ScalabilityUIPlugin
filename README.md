What is it?
---------------------------------------
ScalabilityUI is an Unreal Engine 4 plugin that triggers a poping up window when you start the game (but not the editor) and allow users to lower graphical settings to help them hit 75 fps.

Features

+ You can change the banner image by replacing this file;

Setting up the editor and project
---------------------------------------
Then copy the `ScalabilityUIPlugin` folder into the "Plugins" folder within your **project** directory, or you can copy it to Engine's "Plugins" fold, by default the plugin is enabled.

Re-generate your project's Visual Studio file and load up the editor. Then check the plugin list to ensure it has been loaded!
